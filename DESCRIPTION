Description: This package provides plotting functions to construct standard stratigraphic plots
    based on the Grammar of Graphics implementation in R i.e., ggplot2. Most importantly,
    it facilitates the creation of multi-facetted plots where fine control of plot parameters
    e.g. axis breaks and labels, relative sizes of multiple facets is possible.
    Plot aesthetics can be controlled easily using the traditional layering paradigm of ggplot2.
    The package also provides several functions to compute occurrence scores for pollen data e.g.
    biome and PFT scores.
    For efficiency, all the data wrangling in this package is done using data.table.
