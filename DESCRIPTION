Description: This package provides plotting functions to construct standard
    stratigraphic plots based on the Grammar of Graphics implementation in R i.e.,
    ggplot2. Most importantly, it facilitates the creation of multi-facetted plots
    where fine control of plot parameters e.g. axis breaks and labels, relative
    sizes of multiple facets is possible. Plot aesthetics can be controlled easily
    using the traditional layering paradigm of ggplot2. The package also provides
    several functions to compute occurrence scores for pollen data e.g. biome and
    PFT scores. For efficiency, all the data wrangling in this package is done using
    data.table.
